# Samsung-HVAC-buscontrol
## Purpose
Samsung airconditioners can be controlled by a wired remote controller. I was wondering if I could replace the wired remote controller with my own home automation system. Thats why I started to investigate how the communication works between the controller and the airconditioner.
So far I reverse engineered the communication protocol and with the information I found I can already do some basic control of the airconditioning. The purpose of this repository is to complete the protocol details as much as possible to allow anybody else connect Samsung airconditioners to their own home automation systems.

Note that this does not describe the communication protocol of a wireless IR controller !!
